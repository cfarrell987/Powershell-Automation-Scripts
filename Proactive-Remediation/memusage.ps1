# Description: This script is for use with Intune Endpoint Analtics and Proactive Remediation. Provides a readout of the current memory used in percentage.
#         If the memory usage is above 85.5% it will raise a warning in Intune otherwise will exit as normal.

$MemUsageLimit = 85.5
#Create a custom variable attached to the Win32_OS class, this is for simplicity in writing and readablity
$CompObject = Get-WmiObject -Class WIN32_OperatingSystem
#Retrieve the Total Available Memory, Divide  by Total Free * 100 to get a percentage
$Memory = ((($CompObject.TotalVisibleMemorySize - $CompObject.FreePhysicalMemory)*100)/$CompObject.TotalVisibleMemorySize)
# Round the decimal places to 2 for readability.
$MemRounded = [math]::Round($Memory,2)
